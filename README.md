Overview

The Random Quote Generator is a beginner-friendly C# project that demonstrates core programming concepts. This application uses an array to store a collection of motivational quotes and the Random class to select one at random each time the program is executed. Its simplicity makes it a perfect learning tool for understanding arrays, random number generation, and basic console I/O in C#.

Features

Random Quote Display: Every execution displays a different motivational quote.

Ease of Use: Designed with simplicity in mind; no complex libraries or dependencies.

Beginner-Friendly: Ideal for beginners looking to understand basic C# programming concepts.

Standalone Application: Runs directly on any machine with a compatible .NET runtime.

Code Explanation

Array of Quotes:
The quotes array stores multiple string literals. Each string is a motivational quote.
